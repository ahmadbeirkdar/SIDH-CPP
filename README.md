# SIDH-CPP

SIDH implementation in C++20 in the works

To experiment with modern features for a fast, efficient and modular library.

Plan: A SIDH library implementation in C++ that is fully modular. Also to allow usage on mostly all 8,16,32,64 bit systems. If this is developed to a good working implementation in C++, wrappers come later for other languages such as Python, Rust, Julia, and Java.

Tested with Clang 11.

Currently working on:

BigInt:
* Compile time primes, based on BigInt template type  - Done
* Addition - Done
* Subtraction
* Modular arithmetic
* Multiplication
* constexpr everything possible ;p

Steady progress is all I got to promise. Tight schedule, university, and work.
